Wearing face masks is one of the most controversal problems in our current situation.
Let's put to gether some good reasons, why wearing face masks is a pretty good idea for everyone
to do, when mingling with other people.

## The CDC says

On there prevention recommendations webpage at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html
the CDC says:

> If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring 
> for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks 
> may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

The CDC is wrong.

## Only useful when infected

The argument "A face mask does not help you from becoming infected" is correct.
But it only holds for exactly one person that is proven to be not infected affecting another person. 
It needs no scientific knowledge that there are more than two people living on this planet.
Please take into account the big picture.

Ask yourself: "How can I know for sure that I am not infected, at any time?"

## Education

Wearing a face mask is encouraging others to do the same and this is what is protecting you.

## The wasting resources problem

One argument says, clinics are in need of face masks and people are using up 
medical resources. But: Normal face masks don't have enough protection to be useful
in clinics, they primarily help avoidig speard of the vires.

Face masks can be mass produced like toilet paper and plastic bags. So are we wasting resources?

And what about beeing in short supply? Please understand how free market works: First deamnd, then supply!

## Prioritize

If there are really not enough masks, start with:

It makes sense for exposed people, like shop staff, policemen, cab drivers to wear masks.

It makes sense for people handling food or cleaning staff to wear masks.

Not to protect themselves, but to avoid spreading the virus to many, many others.

## Cities in Comparison

Walking through Bangkok and Singapore in February, I did see about 40% or 25% of the people
wearing face masks in public transport, respectively. Seeing images from Hong Kong recenly, I deduct that
nearly 100% of the people there wear face masks while in public. In Hong Kong there is no shortage 
in face masks. In Bangkok I was able to buy a 50 pieces face mask pack for a few bucks.

From these three, Hong Kong was the one with the lowest infections. Unfortunately, the numbers
went up the recent days, after many imported cases of fleeing to Hong Kong.

Looking at the infection rates, it seems areas with more face mask usage have lower infections.

## More space

Beeing the only one wearing a face mask gives you guaranteed extra space in public transport!

## Non Discriminate

If only infected should wear face masks, we do tag and categorize people. As a German I say:
Please do not do that!

Depending in which city you are at the moment, you either get looks for wearing a face mask
or you get the looks for not wearing a face mask.

## Easy to explain, Easy to understand, Easy to verify

We need simple and effective rules that can be followed

## Just cover your mouth and nose

If no face mask is available, just cover your mouth and nose with something else

## Will it stop the spread?

Do you trust your surgeon about not getting an infection?
